# MSc_project

### 26 Aug 2022
* This week I completed chapter 2 of the book (Deep learning with PyTorch).

* And I am currently interested in indoor positioning with wifi, and I have read Indoor_positioning_system and Wi-Fi_positioning_system Wikipedia pages and looking for some research papers in the same field.
